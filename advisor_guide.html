<p><a href="https://jbhuang0604.github.io/">Back to my personal webpage</a></p>
<p>We are hiring!! Below I answer all the questions from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o2ZTrUQYDXKbMlcmSH8lE-MW5vOX77PR/view">The Definitive ‘what do I ask/look for’ in a PhD Advisor Guide</a>.
Hopefully, this will give you ideas of what does it look like to work with us.</p>
<h3>Advisor Style &amp; Expectations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Does the professor have tenure yet? (engagement level, PhD might get interrupted)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: I do! I just got my tenure in 2022. Hooray! </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>What is the professor’s formal training / background / PhD? (helps contextualize problems/approaches)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: I studied VLSI and Circuit Design as an undergrad in Taiwan.
For my PhD, I switched to work on Computer Vision in the ECE department at UIUC. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>What have previous lab members done after getting their PhD (Gone to industry?/Post-doc?/Professor?)?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Currently, I have four samples. 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jchoivision/">Jinwoo Choi</a> joined Kyung Hee University as an Assistant Professor;
<a href="https://badouralbahar.github.io/">Badour AlBahar</a> will join Kuwait University as an Assistant Professor;
<a href="http://chengao.vision/">Chen Gao</a> joined Meta as a Research Scientist; 
<a href="https://yuliang.vision/">Yuliang Zou</a> joined Waymo as a Research Scientist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>What is the lab structure? (how collaborative/disjointed are lab members&rsquo; projects?)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Usually each student has projects that he/she is leading.
Lab members are freely to collaborate with each other if there is a match.
All the project slack channels in our lab are public (within our group) so you get to see what everyone else is working on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Does the advisor consider themselves a ‘hands-on’ or ‘hands-off’ advisor?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Both.
For junior students, I tend to be more hands-on and help iron out many low-level details to the best extent I can.
As students become more senior/mature, I would gradually transit to a hands-off advisor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>How does the advisor give feedback on papers/what is their feedback style?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: I give specific and detailed feedbacks on every single figure and table.
Whenever time permits (i.e., no deadline pressure), I would provide feedbacks on how the students can revise the paper.
The students revise the paper. 
Then I give another round of suggestions.
It's a slow iterative process, but it's an excellent way of training writing skills.
With deadline pressure, I would revise the paper directly.
Using overleaf the students can learn from the before/after comparison.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>How often does the advisor meet with their students? (1:1 or all together? Daily guidance by PI or post-doc?)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Aside from project meetings, we have weekly 30-mins 1:1 for each student.
I also set aside late-night discussions time slots (often 10:00 PM - 11:20 PM) where students can sign up if they want to have more in-depth discussions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Are there lab meetings? What are other meetings you will see your advisor in a group with other people?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A:
1) <b>Group meetings</b>: Everyone talks about what they are doing in the past week and what they will do next week.
2) <b>Reading group</b>: Presenting/discussing interesting papers in the field.
3) <b>Study group</b> (before the pandemic): Watching online tutorial videos together.
Check out the reading group <a href="https://github.com/vt-vl-lab/reading_group">here</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>What does a group/lab meeting look like? (Or other relevant meetings)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: It's like a standup meeting. Each person talks about their work and plan for 2-4 mins.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>How many students are in the group? (Number of undergrad/masters/phd/post doc)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A:
Check out our [jbhuang0604.github.io/index.html</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>What progress does the advisor generally expect from a student in the course of a semester? (Submission/Publication pace)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A:
I expect the student complete and <i>submit</i> a project to one of the top conferences each year.
It does not have to be accepted because the reviewing could be noisy, but it's important to complete a project and submit it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>What other expectations does the advisor have for their students: time/vacation/paper/project/experiment wise etc.</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A:
<b>Goal</b>: Maximize fun.
<b>Time</b>: You have the freedom to work whenever you want.
<b>Place</b>: You have the freedom to work wherever you want.
But before the pandemic, I usually work in the lab so it may be easier to find me for a quick discussion.
<b>Vacation</b>: I think it's 5-6 weeks per year (usually during the winter break).
<b>Project</b>: I expect the students to stay on top of the projects they are leading and communicate well with all the people involved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“When have you given a letter of concern? Why?”</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: When a student does not meet the expectation (completing and submitting a work in a year) and is not on track.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“What do you do when students are struggling”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: First try to identify the problems, e.g., motivation, external obligations, implementation skills, communication issues?
Then, discuss with the student to come up with strategies for addressing the problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research Fit &amp; Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><b>How directly applicable will your future technical skills be to the roles you want after graduating. (If set on industry)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: I would imagine that most of the future technical skills on computer vision and machine learning will be applicable to many (either research or engineering) roles in industry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>What ‘research methods’ does the lab use? (What ‘types’ of papers / contributions / conferences targeted)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Our work is often empirically driven and focuses on developing robust algorithms that work under unconstrained environments (e.g., everyday photos/videos).
Target conferences are Vision CVPR/ICCV/ECCV; Graphics: SIGGRAPH/SIGGRAPH Asia; Learning: ICLR/NeurIPS.
For work that we wish to extend, we also publish at IEEE T-PAMI / IJCV.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“What are some of the projects that you and your students are currently working on”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: We are working on various computational photography projects, including view synthesis, 3D photos/videos,
and generative models for controllable image/video synthesis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“In general, do you tend to give your students projects or have them select their own”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: It depends.
I prefer students to develop and pursue their own ideas.
However, this could be challenging for junior students.
For junior students, I tend to constrain the project scope a bit so that they can focus on developing their research skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“Do you have particular projects that you see me working on”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: It depends on your background and interests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“How much freedom do you think I’d have in selecting my own projects”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: We need to brainstorm together to find projects (or research directions) that we both are passionate about.
For example, if you select a project that is entirely outside my expertise, then I won't be able to provide the support you need.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“Are there other students you are interested in working with? If so, what would they be working on project-wise”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: I will be able to answer this after reviewing the pool of applicants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“Would they have their own line of work or contribute to a bigger project/someone else’s project”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: It's up to you.
My experience is that leading a project yourself is the best way to get you started for learning how to do research.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Funding / Obligations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Where does their funding primarily come from? (If military / industry-focused funding bothers you, figure this out)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: My funding sources are from National Science Foundation and industrial funds (e.g., Facebook, Google, Adobe, Denso, Samsung).
I have never received military-focused funding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>What are their constraints from their funding source? (Some restrict research topic and change final deliverables. Some add
work — writing progress reports, traveling, preparing presentations for the funding source or engineering overhead for
integration)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Occasionally I may need your assistance on progress report and presentation if you are funded through specific grants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>If your advisor made you work on a project in their area that you are least interested in (e.g. for a grant) would you still be
excited doing that work? (Useful for choosing between advisors)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: It depends on your interests, and I will bring this up front if we are recruiting students with specific background for a grant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“If you run out of your primary funding for a student how do you expect the student to handle that” (advisor’s responsibility /
you’ll have to write a grant with me / dept will cover the student / you have to find their own funding)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: In general, it's advisor’s responsibility. But as a fallback, the department can also cover the student with TAship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“What does the quals process look like”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: The department has a very detailed <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/grad/policy-manual">graduate policy manual</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“Is there a TA requirement”? / “How often would I be expected to TA”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: I am not aware if there is a TA requirement from the university or the department.
But I do strongly recommend doing a TA in your first or second year.
Teaching is a great way to learn the fundamentals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Student-Advisor Fit / Placement</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><b>[If you are interested] Would the advisor be interested in co-advising?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Sure thing. If co-advising helps your research, why not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“Are you taking a student” / “Do you have funding to take students in this year (or, for which projects)”</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: We always are looking for new students each year. I plan to recruit 2-4 PhD students starting Fall 2023.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“What factors will affect whether or not you take a student”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Research interests, background, and motivation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“How do you anticipate your funding to change during my time as a student”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: I don't anticipate any changes. 
Your time as a student will be fully funded either by research assistantship or teaching assistantship (if you wish).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“Do you think our research interests are a good match”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Let me know what you like to work on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“Are there other students in my cohort that you’re interested in working with”? (If so, are you taking more than one student?)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Not yet. I plan to recruit 2-4 PhD students this year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“I’m interested in working with you. Do you think I’d have a good chance of working with you if I come to your university”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: I would be more than happy to chat! 
If you come, we can work on a small-scale project and see if this is what you are looking for.
In the meantime, feel free to reach out to other faculty and explore different opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>“Are there other faculty you think I’d be a good match for”?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Yes! Check out the list of faculty members grouped by areas. Here are a couple of areas that overlap with mine.
<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/research-area/computer-vision-and-machine-perception">Computer Vision and Machine Perception</a>,
<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/research-area/machine-learning-and-data-science">Machine Learning and Data Science</a>,
<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/research-area/graphics-visualization-and-vr-ar">Graphics Visualization and VR AR</a>,

<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/researcharea/natural-language-processing">Natural Language Processing</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Co-advising</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><b>How much overlap would they have in research?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Ask me and I will let you know.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Have these advisors co-advised in the past? Or worked together in the past?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: I am currently co-advising students with two other faculty.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lab Culture</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><b>How often do grad students get to attend conferences? (Pace + What constraints)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: I support <i>all</i> the graduate students in my lab to attend conferences (especially CVPR because it does not involve international travel).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Do students mostly work with senior students or directly with professor?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Mostly directly with me, but you are encouraged to collaborate with senior students with similar interests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>How many conferences are students expected to target a year? (remember pubs ≠ submissions)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: One. Either CVPR or ECCV/ICCV. Some students focus on SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Asia and occasionally ICLR and NeurIPS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>How often do students take time off? Are there lab / department outings/events?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: 
<b>Time off</b>: Whenever you feel like you need it.
<b>Lab dinner/gathering</b>: Usually once/twice a semester.
<b>Department outings/events</b>: I don't know yet, but I received emails about Ice Cream social events so I guess there may be some fun events throughout the semester.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Are there snacks in the lab?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Sort of. I will refill the bucket of snacks in the lab from time to time (especially before the deadline).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Is the professor in an 80/20 with a company? Are student’s research projects tied to industry funding?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Yes, some students&rsquo; projects are tied to industrial funding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Will it be acceptable/encouraged to intern at a company during the summer? (Does this change with seniority?)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Yes, it's highly encouraged to do a summer internship! 
Our lab is usually empty during summer.
Companies where my students did their summer internships:
Google (Esther 2019/2020; Chen 2020/2021; Yuliang 2020),
Facebook (Chen 2019),
Adobe (Yuliang 2018, Badour 2021),
NEC (Jinwoo 2018/2019; Yuliang 2019),
Waymo (Yuliang 2021),
Snap (Yiran 2021, Yue 2021).
No, this does not change with seniority.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Do students work together in common space? Is their common space? Do students often get meals together?</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Sort of. Due to office space limitation, students are sitting in two different offices. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Do students often work late? (Often / only before conference deadlines.)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: Mostly before conference deadline, but I would imagine that some students also work late often.
Reach out and chat with my students to learn more!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>How often are students expected to be contactable by their advisor. (Email, slack, hangouts. Online around the clock?)</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>A: 
If I don't know you are off the grid or busy with courses or other obligations,
I would probably expect that you are contactable in a day via slack.</p>
</li>
</ul>
